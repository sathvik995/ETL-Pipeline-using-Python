# Developing Data ETL Pipelines with Python

Developing Data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines is one of the most valuable skills for Data Engineers. ETL processes involve extracting data from a source, transforming it through various processes, and loading it into a database. This README will guide you through the steps to develop a Data ETL pipeline using Python.

## Overview

The Data ETL process is crucial for data management and involves three main stages:
1. **Extract:** Gathering data from a source system.
2. **Transform:** Processing or modifying the data to meet specific requirements.
3. **Load:** Storing the transformed data into a database for future use.

If you are interested in learning how to develop a Data ETL pipeline, this guide will provide you with the essential steps and an example implementation in Python.

## Summary

In this article, you will learn how to:

- **Extract** data from a source.
- **Transform** the data through various operations.
- **Load** the data into a database for analysis or future use.

ETL stands for **Extracting**, **Transforming**, and **Loading** the data, which are the core components of the ETL process.

## Getting Started

To get started with developing a Data ETL pipeline, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install sqlite3 tensorflow
